# Exposure — AI Photo Coach Mobile App

## Summary

Build `Exposure`, an Android-first Expo photo app that opens directly into a camera and becomes an AI-assisted studio after capture or import. It analyzes photographic quality, localizes issues, recommends camera settings, applies reversible corrections, curates portfolios, and reproduces editing styles from reference photos.

Brand and identifiers:

- Display name: `Exposure`
- Expo slug: `exposure`
- Android package: `com.ht62026.exposure`
- Internal product copy should consistently call the app `Exposure`

Hard requirements:

- Prefer deterministic processing or specialized models when reliable.
- Use Gemini for semantic interpretation and Nano Banana for genuine generative work.
- Prioritize performance through proxies, concurrent analysis, caching, and local previews.
- Never overwrite or bake changes into the original photograph.
- Store filters, adjustments, masks, imported images, and generative patches as layers superposed over an immutable original.

## Architecture and Non-Destructive Editing

Use:

- Expo SDK 57/React Native for the Android application.
- Auth0 for accounts; Supabase for Postgres, private Storage, Realtime status, preferences, and history.
- One FastAPI service for deterministic analysis, Gemini orchestration, authoritative rendering, and generative diff extraction.

The source of truth for every photo is:

```text
Immutable original + reversible canvas transform + ordered layer stack
```

Flattened previews and exports are derived files only.

Layer types:

- `AdjustmentLayer`: exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, temperature, tint, saturation, vibrance, sharpening, denoise, grain, and vignette.
- `MaskedAdjustmentLayer`: adjustments restricted by a subject mask, polygon, color range, or painted mask.
- `ImageLayer`: uploaded or generated image superposed with transform, opacity, blend mode, and mask.
- `RetouchLayer`: synthesized background patch covering a distraction while preserving the underlying pixels.
- `GenerativePatchLayer`: Nano Banana donor patch with its mask, target region, prompt, and provenance.
- `StyleLayer`: reusable adjustments extracted from inspiration photos.
- `CanvasTransform`: reversible crop, rotation, perspective, and canvas expansion.

Users can toggle, reorder, adjust, or remove layers. Cropping hides pixels without deleting them; removal covers pixels without erasing them; export creates a separate flattened file.

Each committed version stores an immutable layer-stack snapshot. Render caches can be regenerated without losing edits.

## Capture, Analysis, and Editing

### Capture and Import

- Use Expo SDK 57 `CameraView`, requesting EXIF and permanently copying temporary captures.
- Unmount the camera whenever its tab is unfocused.
- Import JPEG, PNG, and HEIC through DocumentPicker/ImagePicker.
- Support USB files exposed through Android’s Storage Access Framework.
- Preserve the original file and metadata privately.
- Generate a 1600-pixel analysis proxy and 320-pixel thumbnail.
- Queue offline captures for later synchronization.

[Expo SDK 57](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/), [Expo Camera](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/sdk/camera/).

### Analysis Routing

| Capability | Primary method |
|---|---|
| EXIF and camera metadata | EXIF parser |
| Exposure, clipping, contrast, color cast | Luminance/RGB/Lab histograms |
| Blur and camera shake | Laplacian variance and directional blur |
| Noise and sharpness | OpenCV/scikit-image |
| Horizon, angle, and symmetry | Hough/LSD lines and mirrored-edge comparison |
| Thirds and framing | Subject centroid, intersections, margins, and crop geometry |
| Negative space | Foreground mask and occupied-area ratios |
| Leading and motion lines | Line detector plus semantic direction |
| Faces and people | MediaPipe face/pose models |
| Saliency and distractions | Saliency, edge density, and color/brightness outliers |
| Main subject and background | Deterministic saliency with Gemini segmentation fallback |
| Mood and photographic intent | Gemini semantic reasoning |
| Generative Amplify/Expand | Nano Banana donor-patch generation |

Deterministic and Gemini analysis run concurrently. Gemini receives the proxy plus measured evidence and returns validated structured output.

Every issue contains at least a normalized bounding box, with optional polygon, mask, or polyline for more precise localization. [Gemini image understanding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding).

### Analysis Categories

- Composition: thirds, symmetry, tilt, horizon, perspective, framing, balance, negative space, leading lines, and motion direction.
- Focus: main subject, background separation, focus placement, edge sharpness, and competing focal points.
- Color: palette, contrast, intensity, temperature, harmony, subject/background separation, and colors to boost or dull.
- Lighting: exposure, dynamic range, clipping, direction, hardness, uneven illumination, mixed lighting, and subject/background brightness balance.
- Distractions: awkward shapes, border intersections, bright spots, color outliers, clutter, and framing conflicts.
- Intent: determine whether technical choices support the apparent mood; intentional tilt may reinforce intensity rather than count as an error.
- Metadata: camera, lens, capture time, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, orientation, GPS availability, and subject distance when present.

Each issue includes its evidence, severity, confidence, explanation, location, recommended action, and a Fix control when safely editable.

### Camera Recommendations

Use visible evidence and EXIF to recommend:

- ISO
- Aperture/f-stop
- Shutter speed
- Focal length
- Subject distance
- Stability or tripod use
- Lighting position, diffusion, fill, or exposure compensation

Recommendations explain tradeoffs and never invent missing measurements.

### Editing and Generative Diff

Issue-to-edit mapping:

- Framing → reversible crop transform.
- Tilt/perspective → transform matrix.
- Exposure/color/lighting → global or masked adjustment layer.
- Subject emphasis → masked brightness, contrast, sharpness, or color layer.
- Distraction → retouch patch.
- Missing element → generative patch.
- Negative space → crop or generative canvas expansion.
- Irrecoverable blur/focus → honest retake advice.

Generative workflow:

1. Render the current original-plus-layers composition.
2. Decompose each Amplify prompt into the minimum set of independently controllable visual instructions; generate and name one layer per instruction.
3. For bounded Amplify edits, crop enough surrounding context to make the selected real-world subject visually unambiguous; send that crop and its remapped target to Nano Banana. Send the full expanded canvas for outpainting.
4. Align each generated candidate with the input.
5. Choose extraction by edit geometry instead of forcing every result through a diff: use a localized Lab difference map for bounded Amplify layers, but use the complete target band for canvas expansion because every pixel there is newly generated.
6. For localized edits, use pixels outside the intended region to estimate global color drift and codec noise, then restrict the edit alpha to the exact intended region.
7. Remove isolated noise, pad the solid donor area, and feather the localized mask into matching context so source edges cannot bleed through.
8. For expansion, keep the new target band solid and complete so dark generated pixels are not mistaken for an unchanged black placeholder, then crossfade across a narrow declared overlap on the old canvas edge to prevent a hard seam.
9. Extract the selected generated pixels as RGBA donor patches, map crop-local patches back onto the full canvas, and store each patch and mask separately.
10. Superpose every patch as its own named generative layer.
11. Record unrelated drift diagnostically, but never composite generated pixels outside the intended mask or replace the full photograph.

The generated image is never substituted for the photograph; it only supplies localized pixels to add or cover. [Nano Banana image editing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation).

## Accounts, History, Portfolio, and Inspiration

- Persist Supabase sessions and open directly to Exposure’s Camera after initial sign-in.
- Navigation: Camera, Library, Portfolio, Looks, Settings.
- Studio: canvas, issue overlays, analysis cards, Coach, Edit, Layers, and History.
- Preferences: skill level, feedback detail, desired mood, export metadata, and accepted/rejected recommendations.
- Keep GPS private and exclude it from Gemini requests and exports by default.

History:

- Slider movement updates a local draft layer.
- Apply commits one layer-stack snapshot.
- Recommended and generative fixes add layers and versions.
- Restoring an old state creates a new current version from that stack.
- Disabling every layer reveals the exact original.
- Editing after restoration preserves all intervening history.

Portfolio:

- Review up to 20 selected photos for technical quality, impact, consistency, and subject clarity.
- Detect near-duplicates and choose the strongest representative.
- Recommend a coherent set and ordering with explanations.
- Never delete or hide excluded photos.

Looks:

- Select 3–8 inspiration photos.
- Extract palette, tone curve, temperature, contrast, saturation, grain, vignette, crop tendencies, and mood.
- Save the result as a reusable `StyleLayer`.
- Apply with adjustable strength.
- Preserve target content unless the user explicitly requests a generative structural change.

## Interfaces and Storage

Core records:

- `profiles`: account and preferences.
- `photos`: owner, immutable original, EXIF, current version, and capture source.
- `photo_versions`: parent/restored-from version, canvas transform, layer-stack snapshot, and render caches.
- `layer_assets`: masks, donor patches, imported images, and generated assets.
- `analyses`: deterministic metrics, subjects, lighting, composition, color, camera advice, issues, and model versions.
- `style_profiles`: references and reusable style layers.
- `portfolio_reviews`: selected photos, rankings, groups, and explanations.
- `jobs`: idempotency key, operation, progress, result, and error.

Shared types:

- `POST /v1/layers/generative`
- `POST /v1/portfolio-review`
- `POST /v1/style-profile`
- `POST /v1/style-apply`
- `POST /v1/coach`

Use owner-only row-level security, private Storage buckets, short-lived signed URLs, and direct client uploads. Service credentials remain backend-only.

## Performance and Tests

Performance:

- Analyze resized proxies rather than originals.
- Run deterministic and Gemini processing concurrently.
- Use one structured Gemini call per version.
- Cache results by image checksum and model/schema version.
- Use Skia for local previews and FastAPI for authoritative renders.
- Upload originals once and deduplicate layer assets.
- Paginate Library results and use FlashList.

Acceptance tests:

- Verify the original remains byte-for-byte unchanged after every workflow.
- Disable all layers and recover the exact original.
- Delete render caches and reconstruct them from the layer stack.
- Confirm filters, crops, imported images, removals, additions, and Looks remain independent layers.
- Reject generative changes outside their intended masks.
- Keep boxes and masks aligned through orientation, crop, and perspective changes.
- Validate exposure, blur, tilt, contrast, color, lighting, and distraction fixtures.
- Confirm intentional mood choices are not blindly penalized.
- Ensure camera advice never invents EXIF.
- Test camera capture, Android/USB import, offline sync, history restoration, portfolio ranking, and Look application.
- Verify account and Storage isolation.
- Target camera response under 1 second, deterministic analysis under 3 seconds, combined analysis under 15 seconds, and generative edits under 20 seconds when provider latency permits.
- Produce an Android debug APK and run TypeScript, Python, API, rendering, schema, and security tests.

## Assumptions

- All user-facing branding uses `Exposure`.
- Android is guaranteed; iOS remains source-compatible but is not a release gate. Web is excluded.
- RAW development and direct tethered camera control are excluded from v1.
- Supabase is the only account, database, and storage platform.
- Lightroom APIs are not required; exports use Android’s share sheet.
- Gemini output is validated and model IDs remain environment-configurable. [Gemini structured outputs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output).
- The current blank Expo SDK 57 scaffold and Supabase CLI configuration are retained; no feature implementation or database migration has been completed.
